### There are many web server. Why use fly?

Fly is designed to use as easy and fast tool for:

 * Custom presentations.
 * Documentation sites.


<a name="install"></a>

***

### INSTALL

Add Fly and its package dependencies to your go `src` directory. If you are new on go, read about [how to install](https://golang.org/doc/install) `go`.

```
$ go get -v github.com/ivan-iver/fly
```

Once the get completes, you should find your new fly (or fly.exe from windows) executable sitting inside $GOPATH/bin/.

To update fly's dependencies, use go get with the -u option.

```
$ go get -u github.com/ivan-iver/fly
```

<a name="run"></a>

***

### RUN

After the get completes, you can run `fly`:

```
$ fly
```

<a name="uninstall"></a>

***

### UNINSTALL

One way is delete the archive files and executable binaries that go install (or go get) produces for a package something like that:

```
$ rm -rf $GOPATH/src/github.com/ivan-iver/fly
$ rm -rf $GOPATH/pkg/darwin_amd64/github.com/ivan-iver/
$ rm -rf $GOPATH/bin/fly
```

Or use `go clean -i github.com/ivan-iver/fly...` . 

Be sure to include `...` on the importpath (github.com/ivan-iver/fly), since it appears that if a package includes an executable go clean -i will only remove that and not archive files for subpackages,

See `go help clean`, `go clean` has an `-n` flag for a dry run that prints what will be run without executing it.
